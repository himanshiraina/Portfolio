                Himanshi, who?<br>
                I'm a final year student at Graphic Era Hill University persuing Bachelor's Of Technology in Computer Science. 
                A well-motivated, technically competent and a hardworking individual who takes her job seriously and sees things in perspective. 
                Iâ€™m quite easy-going to work with. Organizing and planning comes as second nature to me and I take great pride in the detail of tasks. 
                I am Open to new Opportunities and learnings. Looking for an opportunity to enhance my technical skills and solve real-world problems. 
                Open to learn something new each day. I have worked on different technologies like web development, machine learning, and have a 
                good knowledge of programming languages such as C, C++, Python and Java. I believe in never quitting attitude and willingness to learn new things everyday.
                There's certainly much more to learn, much more problems to solve, and yet much more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
